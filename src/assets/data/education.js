    title: "B.E. Computer Engineering",
    content:
      "During my Bachelor's in Computer Science at Pune University, I delved deep into the foundations and advanced concepts of the field, studying a range of subjects from Data Structures and Algorithms, Object-Oriented Programming, and Computer Networks, to Operating Systems, Cloud Computing, Cyber Security, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. My academic journey was enriched by hands-on projects that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. Noteworthy projects include 'People's Voice,' a MERN stack-based web application designed to bridge the communication gap between citizens and their political leaders; an 'AI Music Player' that leverages Django and ReactJS to customize music playback based on the user's mood through facial expression detection; and 'Meal Planner,' another MERN stack application that assists users in tracking their nutritional intake and creating tailored meal plans. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in computer science and a passion for developing innovative, user-centric software solutions.",
